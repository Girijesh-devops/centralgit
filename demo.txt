cyberithub@ubuntu:~$ git --version
git version 2.25.1

 
Step 3: Remove Older Version(Optional)

It is not necessary to remove the older git version but if you run into some kind of problems then you can remove the older git version by running sudo apt remove git command as shown below.

Step 4: Add PPA Repository

Since we are going to download and install the git package from Git maintainers repository, we need to first add this repo by using sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y command as shown below.

NOTE:
Please note that if you are also getting below gpg key timed out error then you don't need to worry about that. You can safely ignore that error for now.

cyberithub@ubuntu:~$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y
Error: retrieving gpg key timed out.

 
Step 5: Update Your System

Next step is to update the package cache with all the package information from newly added repo by using sudo apt-get update command as shown below.

cyberithub@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update

Step 6: Install Git

Once the repo information is updated, you can download and install the latest git package along with its dependencies by using sudo apt-get install git -y command as shown below.

Alternatively, if you have the older git version already installed and you would like to upgrade it without removing the older one, then all you need to do is to run the same sudo apt-get install git command as shown below. Here as you notice on the output, no new git package is getting installed but the older one is getting upgraded. So depending on your situation, you can choose either way.

Step 7: Check Version

After successful installation, if you now check the current installed version by using git --version command then you will see that this time we have the newest version 2.37.0 available(At the time of writing this article, 2.37.0 is the newest version).

cyberithub@ubuntu:~$ git --version
git version 2.37.0
